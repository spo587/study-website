    <p> In this experiment, you will be judging six pianists playing the same excerpt.</p>
    <p> You should only take part if you are in a quiet place, have good headphones or speakers, and can devote your full concentration for the short time (5-10 minutes) required to complete the experiment. In addition, make sure you are somewhere with a strong enough Internet connection to seamlessly stream audio and video. Your participation is greatly appreciated, and you are invited and encouraged to repeat the experiment for the different excerpts, but you may only judge each excerpt a single time. </p>
