    <p> In this experiment, you will be judging six pianists playing the same excerpt.</p>
    <p> You should only participate if you are in a quiet place, have good headphones or speakers (better than laptop speakers, please), and can devote your full concentration for the short time (5-10 minutes) required to complete the experiment. In addition, make sure you are somewhere with a strong enough Internet connection to seamlessly stream audio and video. Your participation is greatly appreciated! </p>
