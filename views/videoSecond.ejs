<p> Please watch the remaining three pianists, once, in order, and answer the questions below to the best of your ability, given the limited information available. Note that these three are NOT the same as in part 1.</p>



<ul>    
    <% for(var i=0; i<links.length; i++) { %>
        <li>
            <video width="890" height="500" controls>
                <source src="<%= links[i] %>" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag. 
            </video>
        </li>
    <% } %>
</ul>
