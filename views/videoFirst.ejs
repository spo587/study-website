<p> We are investigating how people judge musical performances, and in particular how much they rely on visual vs. aural information. </p>

<p> In this experiment you will first judge performances of the same excerpt by three pianists in silent videos. Then you will judge three more pianists playing the same excerpt in audio recordings. Please watch/listen to each excerpt a single time and then answer the questions below to the best of your ability, given the limited information available. </p>


<ul>
    <% for(var i=0; i<links.length; i++) { %>
        <li>
            <iframe width='890' height='500' src='<%= links[i] %>' frameborder='0'>
                
            </iframe>
        </li>
    <% } %>
</ul>

Please indicate which of the three you believe to be the best overall performance, based on the excerpt you've seen.
