<p> We are investigating how people judge musical performances, and in particular how much they rely on visual vs. aural information. </p>

<p> Please listen to the silent performance excerpts below a single time and then answer the questions below to the best of your ability, given the limited information available. Make sure you are in a quiet, calm place where you can concentrate fully on each excerpt. </p>

<ul>
    <% for(var i=0; i<links.length; i++) { %>
        <li>
            <audio controls>

            </audio>
        </li>
    <% } %>
</ul>

Please indicate which of the three you believe to be the best overall performance, based on the excerpt you've heard.

<input type="radio" name="winner + <%= path %>" value="1" > Pianist # 1
<br>
<input type="radio" name="winner + <%= path %>" value="2">Pianist # 2
<br>
<input type="radio" name="winner + <%= path %>" value="3">Pianist # 3
<br><br>

A panel of expert musicians have separately viewed the entire performances and ranked them. Please indicate your best guess as to whom the panel chose as the winner: <br>
<input type="radio" name="expert-winner + <%= path %>" value="1" > Pianist # 1
<br>
<input type="radio" name="expert-winner + <%= path %>" value="2">Pianist # 2
<br>
<input type="radio" name="expert-winner + <%= path %>" value="3">Pianist # 3
<br><br>

Please indicate how difficult it was for you to decide which was the best performance, 1 being not difficult at all,
5 being moderately difficult, and 10 indicating that you chose randomly between at least two of the performances. <br>
<% for (var i=1; i<11; i++) { %>
    <input type='radio' name='difficulty + <%= path %>' value='<% i %>'> <%= i%>

Did you recognize the music being played in the excerpts, or any of the pianists? If so, please say what section of what piece it was, or which pianist(s) you recognize:<br>
