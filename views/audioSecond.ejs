<p> Please listen to the remaining three pianists, once, in order and answer the questions below to the best of your ability, given the limited information available. </p>



<ul>
    <% for(var i=0; i<links.length; i++) { %>
        <li>
            <audio controls>
            <source src="<%= links[i] %>"" type="audio/wav">
             Your browser does not support the audio tag. Use a real browser!   
            </audio>
        </li>
    <% } %>
</ul>
